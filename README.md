# About

Do you have a boatload of speaking gigs? 
You came to the right place.

Maybe you're a Developer Advocate ü•ë, or just enjoy doing conference talks, meetups presentations, or joining a podcast. Whatever speaking gigs you're into, it is probably hard to keep track of all of them. Could you even tell how many talks did you give last year? how many of them were in a specific country? exactly. It's hard to quantify and track all of them.

That is... until you started using gigsboat ‚õµÔ∏è üéâ

## Why gigsboat?

- ‚úÖ You own your data - do you use a 3rd-party app, or tool to manage your talks? Maybe a Trello board? With gigsboat, you own and manage your data via YAML files, and gigsboat is here to help you transform that into a beautiful Markdown page.

- ‚úÖ It's all open source - Well, gigsboat is open source but also all of your speaking activities, they're all open source and all managed right here in GitHub where it's easy to manage your talks, just like you manage your code projects. It's all transparent and you can share it with your friends, conference organizers, and so on.

- ‚úÖ Zero config - just run the CLI tool and it'll automatically detect source files, and generate a Markdown document for you with all of them.

- ‚úÖ Statistics - gigsboat runs some numbers crunching and gives you stats about your speaking engagements!
